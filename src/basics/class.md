# Classes

Another feature to help you with your future endeavours would be choosing a class. The game has 7 different classes to choose from, all with varying buffs that increase with your level.

| Class | Effect |
|-|-|
| Mage | +1 damage per evolution |
| Warrior | +1 defense per evolution |
| Ranger | Gains a pet to help gather items |
| Raider | +0.1x raidstats per evolution |
| Ritualist | 2x chance of getting loot in adventures, bonus favor to `$pray` and `$sacrifice` |
| Thief | Can `$steal` 10% from a random player |
| Paragon | +1 damage and defense per evolution* |

*The Paragon class is only available to donors
  
To choose a class, type `$class`, scroll through all the classes using the ◀️▶️ reactions and confirm using the ⏺ reaction.  
Make sure you choose correctly. The first time you choose a class, it's free. Changing your class later will cost $5,000.  
You can get a secondary class at level 12. It's impossible to choose the same class twice and, like with the first class, the first time you pick second class is free.  
To see your current class and evolution level, you can also use `$myclass`. Use `$tree` to see all the different classes with their different evolutions.  
Evolution is a stage at which your class level is at, you can evolve once every 5 levels by using `$evolve`.
