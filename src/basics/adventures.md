# Adventures

To embark on an adventure, you use `$adventure [1-30]`.  
Keep in mind that the adventures you can go on relate to your level. For example, when you're on level 2 you can only do `$adventure 1` or `$adventure 2`.  
The adventure number corresponds to the  and the amount of time needed, The higher the difficulty, the higher the chance of getting loot or more powerful gear.  
To check how long until your adventure finishes, use `$status`, and once the adventure finishes you can use `$status` again to complete it and collect your reward! From there you can go on another adventure.  
To see how experienced you are and how much more you need to train to level up, use `$xp`.  
Of course, when starting out, you can't do some of the higher-level adventures, because:

1. You are not high enough level to have unlocked the adventure, and
2. You are most likely not strong enough to come out of the adventure alive due to the low tier weapons you have.

To see your success rate for each adventure you can use the command $adventures or $missions. This will pull up a list of all the adventures and show your success rate with the current items you have equipped on your character.  
You can navigate the list by using the arrow reactions or pressing on the numbers reaction and typing a number from 1 to 30 to select a certain adventure level.
