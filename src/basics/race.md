# Race

Races are a feature that allows you to choose one of five races, all of which give unique stat bonuses.

You choose your race at the beginning and can only change later with reset points.  
Reset points are points you can use to change your deity or race. Every player starts with 2 reset points on default and you can't get anymore.  
On occasion, IdleRPG's developer will host giveaways for reset points. You can join these giveaways in the [IdleRPG Community Server](https://support.idlerpg.xyz/).
