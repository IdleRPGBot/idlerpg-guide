# Boosters

Something else to keep in mind is that you can buy and use specific boosters that can boost your adventures in various ways.

To access the shop to buy boosters, simply use the command `$store`. It explains everything you need to know about boosters.  
If you want to buy in bulk then simply add the amount you want to buy at the end of the command. For example, if you want to buy 10 time boosters, then you will type out the command as so: `$purchase time 10`.

By default, if you want to buy just 1 booster, then you can just use the command without adding a number at the end.  
To use the boosters, use the command `$activate time/luck/money/all`.

An important thing to remember when using boosters is the time to activate them. Their effects will only show when they have been activated, however timing is key:

- Time boosters need to be active before you start an adventure
- Money and luck boosters need to be active before you finish an adventure

This means that you can start an adventure with only an active time booster and activate the other two booster types right before finishing it.
