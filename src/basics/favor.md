# Favor

Ah, favor. Favor is something you can get when you sacrifice your loot to a God. The more favor you get, the better of your chances of getting more luck from your God.
If you get into the top 25 followers, you might get a reward!

`$favor` shows your God and the amount of favor you have with them.

Favor is something players need to gain with their God in order to get Bonus $luck multiplier if they got to Top 25 $followers. `$pray` and `$sacrifice` commands can be used to increase favor.

`$luck` is randomly generated by the bot and can reach from 0.00 to 2.00, the average is 1.00 to all followers of each God.  
This random luck depends on God's luck boundaries (see the [Gods chapter](./gods.md)) and could be different from other followers of other gods.

During the luck generation (usually on Monday), the bot finds the top 25 followers of each God to give them bonus luck. After all the luck factors has been given, all players' favor will be reset to 0 to allow for fair competition in the following week.

> Note: The maximum luck factor is 2.0, even if the additional bonus luck exceeds that number.

To see if you're in the top 25, get your favor amount in `$favor` first then use `$followers 25`. After that, download the given file, and see if your favor amount is there. You can verify by comparing the long numbers against your [User ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).
