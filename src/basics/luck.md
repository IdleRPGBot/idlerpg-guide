# Luck

Luck is a major factor in IdleRPG!  
By default, it will be set to 1.0, initially or without following a God, being neither good nor bad. However, when you follow a God, this luck can and will change drastically. But what does luck do? Well, it has a numerous amount of things that are affected.

The luck factor affects:

- The chances of survival and successfully completing an adventure
- Item stat (damage, armor, value) after surviving adventures
- Money obtained after surviving adventures
- Item stat upon successful `$pet hunt`

Luck factor does NOT affect:

- Gambling chance
- Raids
- Battles or tournaments
- Making children
- `$steal` success chance
