# Getting started

Hello! Welcome to the guidebook for the IdleRPG Bot. This bot is mainly focused around an adventure-style text-based game.  
So, you've just heard of this bot and don't know how to get started? We've got you covered!

Go [here]() to learn how to invite this bot to your server if you haven't already! To get started, you can use `$create [name]` to create your character and begin your journey!  
After creating your character, you can use `$profile`, or just `$p` to view your characterâ€™s profile. You'll be shown your character name, and all of the character stats you need to know, such as attack and defense stats, and the amount of money you have. Here is a quick explanation of what each value means:

If this profile is too complicated, takes too long to load, or you simply don't like it, IdleRPG offers `$profile2`, or `$pp` to view a shorter version, packed into an embed.
