# Contributing with GitHub alone

GitHub offers other ways of contributing if you cannot install Git on your system. The online markdown editor is a powerful tool for editing the book and previewing changes right away.

Once you have created your user account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and read the main [Contributing page](./contributing.md), you're ready to go!

## Forking the project

As regular users don't have file editing permissions in the main repository, you should create a fork - your own copy of the repository - to make changes.
Those changes/additions can later be added into the main repository via **Merge Requests**.

To fork the repository, go to the [main one](https://github.com/IdleRPGBot/idlerpg-guide) and find the button labelled "Fork" toward the top right.
Once you click it, you'll be prompted to select a "namespace".
Simply select your user account, and GitHub will create a fork of the repository for you.
This could take a minute or two.

## Using the Web Editor

To edit files using GitHub's Web Editor is as simple as finding the file and pressing the "Edit" (pencil) button in the top right. You'll be brought into a simple window where you can make changes to your liking.

Once you've done all the changes you wanted, you should find the "Commit Message" field at the top right. Write a short message of what you did, make sure to select that a new branch should be created and press the "Commit Changes" button.

After commiting the changes, you'll be brought to a New Pull Request page, what do to from here is discussed further below.

## Opening the pull request

Once you're on the Pull Request screen, you'll see a title and a description field. Make sure to fill in the title field with a short message of what you changed. The description _could_ include your name (so we can add you to the book authors) among other details.

If that's filled in, hit "Submit Pull Request". From this point on, it's our responsibility to quality check and merge the request. This will add the code to the main repository and update the actual guidebook online.
